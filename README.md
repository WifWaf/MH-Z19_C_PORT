# MH-Z19_C_PORT

A port of the library https://github.com/WifWaf/MH-Z19

This library provides a more flexible C implimentation which utalises pointers to essential functions, rather than a specific microcontroller.

The version ported here is from the PR_2.0.0 brach, not master - this version has functions which are not fully tested.

This library has not been tested between multiple controllers.
